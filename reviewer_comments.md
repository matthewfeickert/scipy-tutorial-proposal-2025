# Tutorial Proposal Reviewer Comments

The submission "[Reproducible Machine Learning Workflows for Scientists with pixi](https://cfp.scipy.org/scipy2025/talk/review/K9KPCJZNPWMRGDN7RMQLCQGMK37HRY3U)" was accepted as a tutorial for SciPy 2025.

SciPy practices a double-open review system.

* **Comments:**

This tutorial covers a topic that has effected SciPy tutorial participants for years &mdash; getting their environments setup for tutorials.
This is an interesting tutorial as it offers a solution to get complex configurations working for people, especially those who need hardware acceleration for AIML problems.
Their proposed tutorial outline seems quite reasonable for the 4 hour duration.
My main concern that keeps me from making this a high recommend is that the tutorial does still need to be created.
I understand they have material to draw from which should decrease the risks.
My one piece of recommendation to the authors and SciPy if going forward with this one is to be clear on the requirements and expectations of the students.
Package management and configuration is something that most new and early Python users struggle with &mdash; sure they can follow pip install instructions where they only need to copy and paste commands, but the experience level required in my opinion should be expanded upon a bit to avoid students coming in with little to no experience and becoming very frustrated.

This is a really interesting tutorial proposal that invites the attendees to dive deep into working with heterogeneous computing platforms via Pixi.
With the rise in the availability of hardware based accelerators for faster scientific computing and the constant need to be able to use a diverse set of available hardware resources, I think this tutorial does have enough appeal to be interesting and useful to a large set of scientific python user community.

The tutorial proposal is extremely detailed and comprehensive.
The presenters also seem to have the appropriate expertise and previous experience to be able to lead this tutorial successfully.
I do believe that learning about Pixi would be genuinely useful and helpful to a large number of attendees and I'm happy to see that cloud based resources would be made available to the attendees to be able to actually use Pixi with hardware accelerators.
I am happy to recommend this tutorial to be included in SciPy 2025.
