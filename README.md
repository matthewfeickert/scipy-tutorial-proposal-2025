# [SciPy 2025](https://www.scipy2025.scipy.org/) Submission Instructions

## Information

## Topics

Tutorials should be focused on covering a well-defined topic in a hands-on manner. We want to see attendees coding! We encourage submissions to be designed to allow at least 50% of the time for hands-on exercises even if this means the subject matter needs to be limited. Tutorials will be 4 hours in duration. In your tutorial application, you can indicate what prerequisite skills and knowledge will be needed for your tutorial, and the approximate expected level of knowledge of your students (i.e., beginner, intermediate, advanced).

We are looking for interesting techniques or packages, helping new or advanced Python programmers develop better or faster scientific applications.

## Information for tutorial presenters

### Selection

Accepted tutorials will be announced late March. Final tutorial materials and instructions for attendees will be due on June 11th. This will include final version numbers of required software, detailed and tested installation instructions, and a test script that can be run by attendees to ensure that they have sufficient time to prepare their laptops before the conference. In addition, there will be a pre-tutorial slack channel created before the conference, and tutorial presenters are expected to make themselves available to help with setup instructions.

### Stipend

In recognition of the effort required to plan and prepare a high quality tutorial, we pay a stipend of $1,000 to each instructor (or team of instructors) for each half-day session they lead.

For the submission you will need the following information:
* A short bio of the presenter or team members, containing a description of past experiences as a trainer/teacher/speaker, and (ideally) links to videos of these experiences if available.
* A list of prerequisite skills expected of attendees, so that participants can choose level appropriate tutorials.
* A description of the tutorial, suitable for posting on the SciPy website for attendees to view. It should include the target audience, the expected level of knowledge prior to the class, and the goals of the class.
* A more detailed outline of the tutorial content, including the duration of each part and exercise sessions. Please include a description of how you plan to make the tutorial hands-on.
* Detailed installation instructions for various common Python environments so that attendees can have everything ready for participating before heading to SciPy.
* If available, the tutorial notes, slides, exercise files, and IPython notebooks, even if they are preliminary.

Authors of exemplary submissions from previous years have generously agreed to share their proposals to help new instructors: https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy-conference/tree/master/data/tutorial_submissions
